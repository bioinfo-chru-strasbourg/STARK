## Operating system

STARK works on Linux systems.
STARK was tested on CentOS 7


## Packages

## CPU and Memory

STARK does not need a minimum of CPU to work, but need at least 8Go memory by CPU.
We recommend ideally 4 CPU and 32Go of memory.
Note that bigger are your data, more CPU is recommended to decrease execution time.
